##0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

C Group projectAlgorithmData structure



##Resources

Read or watch:

•	How do I use extern to share variables between source files in C?

•	Stacks and Queues in C

•	Stack operations

•	Queue operations

##Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General

•	What do LIFO and FIFO mean

•	What is a stack, and when to use it

•	What is a queue, and when to use it

•	What are the common implementations of stacks and queues

•	What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues

•	What is the proper way to use global variables

## Requirements

General

•	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

•	All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89

•	All your files should end with a new line

•	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

•	Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

•	You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable

•	No more than 5 functions per file

•	You are allowed to use the C standard library

•	The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h

•	Don’t forget to push your header file

•	All your header files should be include guarded

•	You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

GitHub

There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

**9. mod**

**10. comments**

Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).

**11. pchar**

Implement the pchar opcode.

**12. pstr**

Implement the pstr opcode.

**13. rotl**

Implement the rotl opcode.

**14. rotr**

Implement the rotr opcode.

**15. stack, queue**

Implement the stack and queue opcodes.

**16. Brainf*ck**

Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line.

•	All your Brainf*ck files should be stored inside the bf sub directory

•	You can install the bf interpreter to test your code: sudo apt-get install bf

•	Read: Brainf*ck

**17. Add two digits**

Add two digits given by the user.

•	Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result

•	The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)

**18. Multiplication**

Multiply two digits given by the user.

•	Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result

•	The result of the multiplication will be one digit-long (<10)

**19. Multiplication level up**

Multiply two digits given by the user.

•	Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result, followed by a new line
